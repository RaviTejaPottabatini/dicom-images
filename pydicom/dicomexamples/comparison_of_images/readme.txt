compare_images:

in this file w compare two dicom images with the user input of the link of the images
we import : pydicom -- for reading the dicom images and data
            difflib  -- for comapre and diiference between the images and data 
            os  -- for reading link of the images
            numpy for pixel data


we first input bothe images link and the code compares and give  TRUE\FALSE statement 
if they are equal prints True and vice versa

if we want to see the attributes which differ in both images just print "ok"

then the requried attribute will be printed.
